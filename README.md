# Auto Swap,pool GTE - MegaETH Tesnet

This repository contains a suite of JavaScript (Node.js) scripts designed to automate various DeFi operations such as managing liquidity pools and executing token swaps on EVM-compatible blockchains, specifically targeting the MegaETH Testnet for GTE. Each script serves a specific purpose and can be configured via its internal `CONFIG` object.

**Disclaimer:** *These scripts interact with smart contracts and manage private keys. Use them at your own risk. Ensure you understand the code and the potential risks involved before using them with real funds. The author is not responsible for any financial losses.*

## General Setup

1.  **Private Keys (`pk.txt`):** All scripts require a `pk.txt` file in the same directory. Each line in this file should be a private key for a wallet you want the script to use.
2.  **Token Lists:**
    * `pool.js` uses `pol.txt` (format: `TokenAddress|TokenName`).
    * `swap-eth.js` and `swap.js` use `sc.txt` (format: `TokenAddress|TokenName`).

## 1. Liquidity Pool Manager (`pool.js`)

Automates adding and withdrawing liquidity for Token/WETH pairs on a DEX, tailored for MegaETH Testnet.

### Features (`pool.js`)

* **Liquidity Operations:** Adds/withdraws liquidity for multiple wallets from `pk.txt`.
* **Token Management:** Uses `pol.txt` for token selection; adds liquidity for a configurable number of random tokens per wallet.
* **Operational Modes:**
    * `Add Liquidity`: Fixed ETH amount, calculated token amount.
    * `Withdraw Liquidity`: Withdraws a configurable percentage of LP tokens.
    * `Full Cycle`: Loops Add -> Cooldown -> Withdraw -> Cooldown.
* **Configuration:** RPC, chain, router, WETH, gas settings, slippage, cycle counts, cooldowns.
* **User Interface:** Interactive menu for mode selection and cycle configuration; colored console logs.

### Configuration (`pool.js`)

Key settings: `RPC_URL`, `CHAIN_ID` (should be set for MegaETH Testnet, e.g., 6342), `ROUTER_ADDRESS`, `WETH_ADDRESS`, `GAS_PRICE`, `FIXED_ETH_AMOUNT`, `TOKEN_LIST_FILE`, `COOLDOWN_HOURS`, `TOKENS_PER_WALLET`, `WITHDRAW_PERCENTAGE`.

### Usage (`pool.js`)

```bash
node pool.js
Follow the on-screen menu.

2. ETH Swap & Unwrap (swap-eth.js)
Swaps various tokens to WETH and then unwraps WETH to native ETH on MegaETH Testnet, with a global cooldown.

Features (swap-eth.js)
Token to WETH Swaps: Swaps 50% of specified token balances (from sc.txt) to WETH.
WETH Unwrapping: Converts all WETH in a wallet to native ETH.
Operational Modes: Swap only, Unwrap only, or Swap + Unwrap.
Multi-Wallet: Processes all wallets from pk.txt.
Cooldown System: Enforces a configurable global cooldown (e.g., 48 hours via cooldown.json) after operations.
Configuration: RPC, chain (for MegaETH Testnet), router, WETH, gas settings, slippage, cooldown duration.
User Interface: Interactive menu for mode selection; colored console logs.
Configuration (swap-eth.js)
Key settings: RPC_URL, CHAIN_ID (e.g., 6342), ROUTER_ADDRESS, WETH_ADDRESS, GAS_PRICE, COOLDOWN_HOURS.

Usage (swap-eth.js)
Bash

node swap-eth.js
Choose operation mode from the prompt.

3. General Token Swapper (swap.js)
Performs a variety of automated token-to-token swaps on MegaETH Testnet in a continuous loop with cooldowns.

Features (swap.js)
Multi-Stage Swap Strategy per Wallet:
Initial Swaps: Random number of CUSD -> Random Token swaps.
Random Swaps: Fixed number of Random Token -> Random Token swaps.
Targeted Swaps: Random number of CUSD -> BRONTO Token swaps.
Continuous Operation: Processes all wallets from pk.txt (shuffled), then enters a long cooldown (e.g., 10 hours) before repeating.
Token Management: Uses sc.txt for token selection.
Configuration: RPC, chain (for MegaETH Testnet), router, gas settings, slippage, BRONTO token address.
User Interface: Detailed colored console logs for swaps and balances; cooldown timer.
Configuration (swap.js)
Key settings: RPC_URL, CHAIN_ID (e.g., 6342), ROUTER_ADDRESS, GAS_PRICE, BRONTO_ADDRESS.

Usage (swap.js)
Bash

node swap.js
Runs continuously with periodic cooldowns.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 14.x or newer recommended.
NPM Packages:
ethers: (e.g., v5.7.2 or your specific version) - For interacting with Ethereum-like blockchains.
chalk: (e.g., v4.1.2 or your specific version) - For colored console output.
readline-sync: (e.g., v1.4.10 or your specific version) - Used by pool.js for synchronous user input.
inquirer: (e.g., v8.2.4 or your specific version) - Used by swap-eth.js for interactive prompts.
pk.txt file: Contains your wallet private keys, one per line.
pol.txt / sc.txt files: Contain token contract addresses and names (format: Address|Name).
Installation
Clone/Download the Repository:
Bash

git clone [https://github.com/AJSPRO/GTE-Auto-Bot.git](https://github.com/AJSPRO/GTE-Auto-Bot.git)
cd GTE-Auto-Bot
Install Dependencies: It's recommended to create a package.json file first by running npm init -y if you don't have one. Then, install the required packages with their specific versions (replace example versions with your actual target versions):
Bash

npm install ethers@5.7.2 chalk@4.1.2 readline-sync@1.4.10 inquirer@8.2.4
Note: Ensure these versions are compatible with your scripts and Node.js version.
Create Data Files:
Create pk.txt and populate it with your private keys.
Create pol.txt (for pool.js) and/or sc.txt (for swap-eth.js, swap.js) and populate them with token details.
Configure Scripts: Open pool.js, swap-eth.js, and swap.js. Modify the CONFIG object at the top of each file to match your target blockchain network (RPC URL for MegaETH Testnet, Chain ID 6342, specific contract addresses, etc.) and desired operational parameters.
